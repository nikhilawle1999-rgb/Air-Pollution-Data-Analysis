Air Quality Data Analysis using Python

This project analyzes air pollution data across multiple countries, states, and cities.
Using pollutant readings from monitoring stations, it identifies trends, pollution hotspots, and regions with better air quality.

Features

Reads and cleans air quality data from CSV

Summarizes pollutant averages (pollutant_avg, pollutant_min, pollutant_max)

Identifies most and least polluted cities

Visualizes air quality trends using charts

Uses location data (latitude, longitude) for geographic insights

Tech Stack

Python

pandas – for data cleaning and aggregation

matplotlib / seaborn – for data visualization
